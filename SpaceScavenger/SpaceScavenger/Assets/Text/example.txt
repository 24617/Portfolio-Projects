Howdy there, fella! You don't look like you're from this colony. The name's Harvey, The best engineer of Mars.. Probably the last one, too.
Still here, huh? All folks 'round here have left since the attack. Help a man out would ya? My whole workplace's been wrecked, I'm trying to fix this Wormhole Portal but I'm missing a tool of mine, fetch it for me and I'll let you use the portal.
You found my tool! Much obliged. Now let's see. Oh there we are, I made it. Now you can go through my portal whenever you wish.
